This project aims to determine the influence of two squirmers on each other.

# Objectives
- Understand the "Squirmers" model
- Study the dynamics between two squirmers
- Develop a code to calculate the movement of two squirmers
- Verify if our results align with previous studies

# Compilation
To compile the project you need to follow these steps:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Reproducibility
To run the eight simulations done in the report you need to run:
```
python3 Code/run.py
```
and the eight resulting graphs are stored in the **graph** directory.
You can modify the simulation parameters by editing the file **Code/run.py**.
